# Monster Manager ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘”

* Monster Manager is a Node.js app that I created to further my knowledge on MySQL and to practice building Content Management Systems.
* I decided to use Monsters Inc as a fake business to seed my database and it was a lot of fun!
* I first started the project by creating the sql database and schema to create the necessary tables for our departments, roles and employees. Then I created the sql seeds to populate the tables with various characters from Monsters Inc.
* After our database was created I moved onto writing the javascript, which I did in two files the app.js and queries.js. My app file is mainly the inquirer prompts. The answers from the various prompts get sent to the queries file where I wrote out our queries for accessing the database.
* I wasn't sure if I wanted to add the result table when an object is changed/deleted or to create a console.log saying "It's been changed!". I decided on the table instead of the log even though it doesn't look as nice because this app is mainly for me to learn and I was interested in viewing all the changes that were happening. This could be quickly changed in a refactor if it is a problem.
* I went for a couple of the extra credit and didn't realize until watching the video that the salary sums were supposed to be by department oops! It was still pretty cool to learn the SUM function though :)
* Overall I had a lot of fun creating this app and learned a lot. It was a challenge but nothing too difficult and very satisfying when everything fell into place.
